Changes
=======

Beta 0.2
--------
Added functionality:
* When uploading, a `irida_uploader_status.info` status file will be created in the run directory
* If a status file exists, trying to upload will fail and give a message saying an upload has already been attempted
* using `--force` or `-f` when uploading bypasses this check

Beta 0.1
---------
* The start of time
