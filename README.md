Creating the Windows installer from source code

A new windows installer can be built on linux, so first see the installation instructions for installing on linux in our documentation.

You will also need `nsis` installed to create the windows installer.

Then run the command:

    $ make windows
    
This will create a new installer in the folder `build/nsis/` with a name similar to `IRIDA_Uploader_1.0.exe`
